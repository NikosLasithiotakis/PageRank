## **PageRank Algorithm with Pthreads**

**This project implements the PageRank algorithm using the Pthreads library in C. The PageRank algorithm is used to rank nodes in a graph, originally designed to rank web pages in search engine results. This implementation reads a graph from an input file, processes it using multiple threads, and outputs the computed PageRank values to a CSV file.**
